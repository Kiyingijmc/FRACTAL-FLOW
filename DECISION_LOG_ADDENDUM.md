# FRACTAL FLOW — DECISION LOG ADDENDUM
Version: 1.0
Status: Architectural Audit Resolutions (Entries D-032 through D-038)

This file records architectural decision entries formulated during the pre-implementation audit, preserving the established decision log conventions of `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.

---

## D-032 — Pullback Candidate Boolean Precedence
* **Context:** `docs/06_PULLBACK_ENGINE.md §4` specified candidate rules as `CounterMoveNorm > θ_counter AND CounterEfficiency > θ_efficiency OR CounterStructuralEvidence = TRUE` without parentheses.
* **Decision:** Reconcile as `(CounterMoveNorm > θ_counter AND CounterEfficiency > θ_efficiency) OR (CounterMoveNorm > θ_min_floor AND CounterStructuralEvidence = TRUE)`.
* **Rationale:** Structural evidence (e.g. key swing break) is primary (AGENTS.md Invariant #35) and can qualify a pullback candidate even if normalized move or efficiency metrics fall below standard threshold, provided a baseline distance floor `θ_min_floor` is satisfied.

---

## D-033 — Quarantined Position Exit Pathway
* **Context:** `docs/14_RECONCILIATION.md §4` defined orphan state `QUARANTINED` when parent lineage cannot be reconstructed after a crash. Inventing a structural trailing stop without valid lineage creates a circular dependency.
* **Decision:** Distinguish two quarantine sub-states:
  1. `QUARANTINED_WITH_VALID_PROTECTION`: Structure intact; Protective Manager trails tight stop until flat.
  2. `QUARANTINED_WITHOUT_VALID_THESIS`: Lineage/structure damaged; broker hard stop remains authoritative + emergency alert. No structural thesis is invented.
* **Rationale:** Prevents inventing unverified trailing theses while maintaining active risk containment.

---

## D-034 — Canonical Pullback Resumption Vocabulary Standard
* **Context:** `docs/02_ENGINE_CONTRACTS.md §5`, `docs/03_STATE_MACHINE.md §3`, and `docs/06_PULLBACK_ENGINE.md §8` defined three incompatible state enums for PDE and resumption.
* **Decision:** Standardize to a primary state `PDEState` (`PDE_RESUMPTION_FAILED`, `PDE_RESUMPTION_IN_PROGRESS`, etc.) and a sub-lifecycle state `PDEResumptionState` (`RECOVERY_CANDIDATE`, `RECOVERY_CONFIRMED`, `DISPLACEMENT_CANDIDATE`, `RESUMPTION_CONFIRMED`).
* **Rationale:** Establishes type-safe state interfaces across Layer 2 (PDE) and downstream consumers without string ambiguity or naming reversals.

---

## D-035 — Lineage Chain Hierarchy Expansion
* **Context:** `docs/00_CONSTITUTION.md` lineage omitted `MICRO PULLBACK` and `OPPORTUNITY` tiers.
* **Decision:** Canonical lineage is updated to: `ROOT → REGIME → SETUP → PRIMARY_PULLBACK → [SECONDARY_PULLBACK →] [MICRO_PULLBACK →] OPPORTUNITY → SIGNAL → ORDER → POSITION → TRADE → MANAGEMENT`.
* **Rationale:** Ensures M1 micro pullbacks and multi-timeframe opportunities satisfy root-to-leaf lineage validation invariants (AGENTS.md Invariants #11, #12, #25, #27).

---

## D-036 — PDE Policy Fields Consumer Authorization Integration
* **Context:** Policy fields on pullback objects (`primary_entry_allowed`, `micro_entry_allowed`, `reentry_allowed`, `runner_management_allowed`) were declared in Doc 06 but never read downstream.
* **Decision:** downstream validity gates (Opportunity Entry Authorization, Smart Overtrading, Runner Management) MUST evaluate these policy flags as mandatory entry/management prerequisites.
* **Rationale:** Eliminates orphaned fields and operationalizes PDE state policy decisions across allocation and position management layers.

---

## D-037 — PDE Layering Isolation & EvidenceConfidence Calibration
* **Context:** `docs/06_PULLBACK_ENGINE.md §14` included `ExecutionConfidence` in PDE's `EvidenceConfidence` formula, violating Layer 2 -> Layer 6 pipeline isolation.
* **Decision:** `ExecutionConfidence` is removed from PDE `EvidenceConfidence` and evaluated strictly downstream in Layer 5/6 decision authorization.
* **Rationale:** Upholds AGENTS.md Invariant #1 (strict layer data flow) and backtesting causal purity (Invariants #23, #24).

---

## D-038 — Opportunity Engine Parent Invalidation Authority Correction
* **Context:** `docs/02_ENGINE_CONTRACTS.md §18` Authority Matrix stated `Opportunity: Invalidates parent = Yes`, contradicting `docs/08_OPPORTUNITY_ENGINE.md §7`.
* **Decision:** Reconcile Authority Matrix: `Opportunity: Invalidates parent = No`.
* **Rationale:** An expiring or untradeable child opportunity must never invalidate its parent regime or setup state (AGENTS.md Invariant #13).
